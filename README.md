## My process

### Built with

-   [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this easy challenge to work on my Tailwind skills. I learned a lot about how Tailwind responsive design works and how it uses many different keywords for familiar CSS properties.

### Continued development

I'd like to use Tailwind in the future for a full website's styling using components from a frontend framework/library such as React.
